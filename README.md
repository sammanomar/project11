## Design

As this is my first project the design has been influenced by the ”Love Running” & "Coffeeshop in Dublin" - projects. I gathered many ideas from various websites and compiled them interactively in this website

My aim has been to create a clean looking website where there is a balance between colors, images and functionality.

Omar Samman website is a 7 pages website with one additional link to download CV. I have video backgrounds. I used JavaScript to add switching between languages functionality and add a menu slider feature in order to ensure easy navigation between the pages.

## Colors

The font color white #fff was used for all pages with black font color for the slide menu and two different degrees of orange color background with shadow effect used for switching between languages in compatible with the colors of videos backgrounds.

## Typography

Poppins was chosen as the body and heading font with a fallback of Sans-Serif.

# 11. Images and Videos

I have not used much images at the website but videos. videos have been chosen in accordance to the color and the content. The purpose of the website is to give a friendly look and express quality. Videos have been sized in order to match design. I have used the two links below to give me the toggled slide menu:
